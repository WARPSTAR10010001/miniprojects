# miniprojects

**Welcome to my "miniprojects"-Repo!** 

I will publish some experimental and "made-for-fun" Java, C++ and C programs here. 

I'm still studying computer science, so don't expect too much from my code in terms of optimization, structure, etc..

Feel free to download, use and modify any of the code posted here.
